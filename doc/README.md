# Predis documentation

You'll need a recent version of Sphinx to build this documentation. Because Sphinx is a Python project,
the build dependencies are listed in requirements.txt. You can install these with pip:

```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To build the documentation, use make.
